CASEY QUESTIONS

0. Let's fix our git repo.

!!!SEARCH PROGRAM CODE IN A FILE NAME!!!

MAKE IT TAKE STRING TO SEARCH FOR. So it can be run by the queue.

0. What's written first, the BDF or the SDM?

1. Do we want to trigger processing per SB or per scan for the test?
   This will change whether I watch a directory and/or a file.
   NOTE: from discussion with Paul 

2. I think I'm not dealing with scandict/scanintent appropriately?
   Also I think it needs a "search per scan", i.e. the SDM won't get
   the intent, the scans should get an intent?

5. How do we call rtpipe within this code? Or should we just wrap
   rtpipe in this boss code?

3. All the "NOTE"s in my code!

4. For now, do we want to remove the archive hardlink as soon as the
   data gets in? Ultimately we should liaise with Martin to have the
   hardlink not written for our obs intent.

6. How do we deal with calibration for this online system???

NOTE HERE ARE THE CHANGES TO MAKE FOR RUNNING IN A ROBUST NON-DEDICATED MODE

1. Dynamically determine usage of slave nodes. This will depend on how
   many nodes the standard correlation intends to take for that
   SB. NOTE THIS SEEMS TO NOT BE SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO; PAUL SAYS
   IT'S ALWAYS JUST 8 NODES AND THAT WHICH NODES ARE SET BY HAND. BUT
   IS THAT ACTUALLY TRUE? NEED TO VERIFY.

2. Determine DM steps based on metadata. Do this either in the
   pipeline itself, or have the CBE boss calculate it from the
   meta-data and write a reference file for that frequency set-up for
   future use.

3. As above for parsing SDM for metadata!
